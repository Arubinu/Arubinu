# ðŸš€ Welcome to my little corner of space!

_Unfortunately I don't speak English at all (but one day who knows!?), but I try to submit my projects in English._

## Otherwise for the little story

I started to be interested very young in computers, technology, as well as science fiction ðŸ˜„
<br />It led me to use __HTML__, then __CSS__, and unsurprisingly Javascript.

Since then I have used __PHP__ and __NodeJS__, but I stopped there to join __school 42__ in 2013.
<br />The __C__ language being at the heart of this establishment _(at least for a good part of the first year)_, it pushed me to be interested in the __Arduino__ _(which easily allows you to go from a code, to a side reaction electronic)_.

I'm not a genius _(far from it)_, but I manage to succeed in my personal projects, which I let you discover with my deposits.

## What else?

Over time, I ended up taking an interest in the __Twitch__ platform, first as a __viewer__, then very quickly as a __streamer__.
<br />I have a lot of fun with those who come to visit me, and always try to improve the channel for myself and for your enjoyment ðŸ”¥

For those interested, this is where it happens: https://www.twitch.tv/arubinu42

<br />__Note:__ If you can leave a little star on the projects you like, that would really please me, thank you ðŸ’•
